# Meaning II
### Pragmatics
the meaning of a sentence when you put it back into its full context


### Indexicals
"index" as in "pointing"
"pointing" expressions
pointing something out in a context

ex. pronouns
- point to someone in the context
- who "me" is depends on who says "me"
pronouns can be difficult in [[language acquisition]]
"we'll talk more about language acquisition next week"

##### deixis and deictic expressions
have to do with time or place
ex. what "today" is depends on the time

egocentric - center around the person speaking
ex. "here" vs. "there" refer to speaker's location
ex. "this" vs. "that" refer to speaker's possession
ex. "left" vs. "right"

"stage right" and "stage left" are used to disambiguate left and right
"portward" and "starward" etc. are used to disambiguate left and right
these are absolute directions

ex. Guguymithir uses cardinal directions instead of egocentric directions
English doesn't use cardinal directions this way, and we don't have a good sense of which cardinal direction is which way
Will Guguymithir speakers have trouble distinguishing which is this and which is that?


### Gricean Pragmatics
invented by guy named Grice

ex. from last class
![[Meaning I#example]]
Grice's question - How does everyone know Mary is not invited
How do we evaluate the unspoken meanings

##### Grice's original formulation
- start with a given: the **cooperative principle**, or the CP
- CP: "make your conversational contribution, such as it is aquired, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose of the talk exchange in which you are engaged, in order to contribute to the conversation"
- "Make your contribution such as is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged."
- ...
- condensed: people cooperate to advance conversation
- when looking for meaning in conversation start with this assumption

came up with 4 maxims that would advance the conversation
not rules; if you break a maxim, it also gives meaning

##### conversational maxims
1. quantity
   - say enough
   - dont say too much / more than you need to say
   - "make your conversational contribution as informative as it is aquired"
2. quality
   - say truth
   - have evidence 
 3. relation
    - be relevant
	- "at that moment" "at the stage at which it occurs"
4. manner
- be percipicuous
- be clear!

can relate to each other - eliminate other possibilites first when trying to deduce which one maxim was broken in an example

##### following, violating, & flouting
maxims can be broken

"we'll use a lot of question/answer examples, but maxims can be applied to any form of conversation"

ex. question: "where does Claire live?"
answer: "somewhere in North Carolina"
- what's going on with the maxims here?
- what was followed / not followed?
	- context: to address a card
	- we need more than "North Carolina" to address the card
	- maxim: quantity - not followed
- "quantity seems to be the sticking point here"
- in the context of asking for the address, given this response, we can calculate the person answering *does not know the address*
- they say truth, are relevant by by responding, and they are clear, but they do not say enough

back to example from last class
![[Meaning I#example]]
maxim: quantity
the answer does not say enough
we assume the person is advancing the conversation, so we assume the person is deliberately leaving Mary out

ex.
context: "my dog is here"

"what are you doing later?"
"going for a W-A-L-K"

unspoken meaning: don't excite the dog, don't say the word "walk"

maxim: manner
not the clearest way to say this, and because it is not, it highlights the unspoken meaning

##### implicators
the unspoken meaning is called the implicator

### Intangibles (to be rewritten)
- Guguymithir speakers are still able to figure out which way is north when they dont know where they are, linguistics research done where speakers are spun around in a building they haven't been in and still know the direction
	- This sucks bc I wish I could do that
